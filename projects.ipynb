    " Python’s os module provides a function with signature walk(path) that is a generator yielding the tuple (dirpath, dirnames, filenames) for each subdirectory of the directory identified by string path, such that string dirpath is the full path to the subdirectory, dirnames is a list of the names of the subdirectories within dirpath,andfilenames is a list of the names of non-directory entries of dirpath. For example, when visiting the cs016 subdirectory of the file system shown in Figure 4.6, the walk would yield ( /user/rt/courses/cs016 , [ homeworks , programs ], [ grades ]). Give your own implementation of such a walk function."
